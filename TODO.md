Current Issues Identified
TypeScript Configuration Issues:
Missing type definitions causing compilation errors
JSX configuration needs adjustment
Path resolution working but types not properly configured
Dual Backend Architecture:
Express server for development (server/)
Vercel serverless functions for production (api/)
Potential conflicts between the two approaches
Build Process:
Build works but has large bundle size warnings
Assets are properly copied during build
Static files are correctly served
Vercel Configuration:
Current config is minimal and should work
No explicit runtime configuration (which is good)

DEPLOYMENT PLAN
Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Configuration (Critical)
Fix tsconfig.json:
Remove problematic types array entries
Ensure proper JSX configuration
Fix path resolution
Verify all imports work:
Test React imports
Test component imports
Test shared schema imports

Phase 2: Optimize Build Process
Reduce bundle size:
Implement code splitting
Optimize imports
Configure manual chunks
Improve build performance:
Update browserslist data
Optimize Vite configuration

Phase 3: Clean Up Architecture
Remove development server dependencies:
Remove Express server files (not needed for Vercel)
Keep only Vercel serverless functions
Update package.json scripts
Simplify project structure:
Focus on Vercel deployment
Remove unused dependencies

Phase 4: Deploy & Test
Deploy to Vercel:
Test deployment process
Verify API endpoints work
Test static asset serving
Post-deployment verification:
Test contact form functionality
Verify all routes work
Check performance
Specific Actions Required
Immediate Fixes:
Update tsconfig.json to remove problematic types
Test build process after fixes
Remove Express server dependencies
Update package.json scripts
Optimizations:
Implement code splitting in Vite config
Update browserslist data
Optimize bundle size
Deployment:
Push changes to GitHub
Deploy via Vercel CLI
Test all functionality
Expected Outcome
After implementing this plan:
✅ TypeScript compilation will work without errors
✅ Build process will be optimized
✅ Deployment will succeed on Vercel
✅ All functionality will work (contact form, static assets, routing)
✅ Bundle size will be reduced
✅ Architecture will be simplified for Vercel deployment
